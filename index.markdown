This is a blog about problems I faced and the solutions I found.
It is also a portfolio of my work.

I'm a freelancing software engineer with strong algorithmic skills and in depth experience
with C# and C++.

At the moment my work entails mainly 3d data processing in digital dentistry
(C++, Qt, vtk, PCL).

for my availability and rates.
