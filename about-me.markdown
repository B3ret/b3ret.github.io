### Relaxed writeup

{% include image_33.html src="/assets/about-me_img.jpg"
                         descr="A picture of me" %}

I was always strongly interested in problems of all kinds, especially riddles, math
problems, and algorithmic problems. After my Mechanical Engineering education in high
school I studied Computer Science at the Graz University of Technology in 2004. Between
receiving my Bachelor’s degree and starting my Master’s studies, I worked as a Software
Tester with IBM in Brussels and fell in love with being a world citizen.

During and after my Master’s degree I was the main architect and developer of a new life
insurance calculation core at the Grazer Wechselseitige insurance company. It went on to
replace three older life insurance calculation cores of the company and its subsidiaries.
After I had integrated these replacements I left the company in 2014 to become a
location-independent freelancer. Nevertheless, I'm still consulting and developing in this
project for a couple weeks each year on-site in Graz.  
Other than that I work primarily remotely. However, for interesting projects, I’m also
willing to temporarily relocate to anywhere in the world to progress or kick-off a project
on-site.

The technologies I mainly employed lately are:

* Modern C++ (vtk, Qt, CMake, Visual Studio, git, PowerShell, OSX porting), and
* C#.NET (ASP.NET, MS Sql/SqlCe, Visual Studio, Team Foundation Server).

I've also been toying around with Android, GoLang, Solitidy/Ethereum, .NET Core, and
others. In addition I’m always interested in discovering new technologies and will adapt
my rate accordingly during the learning phase.

I'm looking forward to hearing about your project and discuss my availability at
