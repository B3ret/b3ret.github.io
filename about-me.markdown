### Relaxed writeup

![A picture of me](/assets/about-me_img.jpg){:style="float: right;margin-left: 20px;margin-top: 20px; width: 33%"}

I always had a strong interest in problems of all kinds, especially riddles, math
problems, and algorithmic problems. After my Mechanical Engineering education in high
school I started studying Computer Science at the Graz University of Technology in 2004.
Between receiving my Bachelor’s degree and starting my Master’s studies, I worked as a
Software Tester with IBM in Brussels and fell in love with being a world citizen.

During and after my Master’s degree I was the main architect and developer at the Grazer
Wechselseitige insurance company to replace the many life insurance calculation cores of
the company and its subsidiaries with a new one written in C#. After the main integration
work was finished, I left the company in 2014 to become a location-independent freelancer.
Nevertheless, I'm still working on difficult modifications for this project for a few
weeks each year on-site in Graz.  
Other than that I work primarily remotely. However for interesting projects, I’m also
willing to temporarily relocate to anywhere in the world to work on or kick-off a project
on-site.

The technologies I mainly worked with lately are:

* Modern C++ (vtk, Qt, CMake, Visual Studio, git, PowerShell, OSX porting), and
* C#.NET (ASP.NET, MS Sql/SqlCe, Visual Studio, Team Foundation Server).

I've also been toying around with Android, GoLang, Solitidy/Ethereum, .NET Core, and
others. In addition I’m always interested in learning new technologies and will adapt my
rate accordingly during the learning phase.

I'm looking forward to hearing about your project and discuss my availability at
[contact@benjaminhopfer.com](mailto:contact@benjaminhopfer.com).
